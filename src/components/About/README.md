# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Exchange Rates

The following task is to be given to prospective candidates as a skill test.
We will be reviewing both the finished product (UI, UX) as well as the code itself.

## Objective

Build a web app that lets the user enter a date and a base currency and, when submitted,
returns a list of foreign exchange rates from a publicly available API as of that date.

## Requirements

## ● Functional:

1. The app should have the following views (implement whatever navigation
    mechanism you deem suitable):
       ● Homepage
       ● About
       ● Exchange Rates (query and results)
          ● The user must be able to enter the following search parameters:
             ● A Date (i.e. to get the FX rates as of that date)
             ● A Base Currency (e.g. with "GBP" as a base currency, the
                ECB's EUR rate was 1.1745 on the 2​nd​ Jan 2017)

## ● Constraints:

1. Use React and its ecosystem.
2. Do not use Bootstrap or any other pre-defined styling library!
3. If you use a scaffolding tool or template, make sure it is cleaned up and presentable
    before submitting your solution!

## ● General:

1. Write a paragraph or two, explaining the following:
    ● What made you choose the approach you were taking when architecting your
       app?
    ● Explain your design decisions: the layout, the styling options etc. What was
       your thought process?
    ● Did you encounter any problems or challenges? If so, how did you resolve
       them?
2. Apart from the restrictions above, you are free to use any supporting libraries at your
    discretion. Be prepared to justify your choices, however!


### ● Delivery:

1. You can send us the code as a link to a Github or other public repo or as a zipped
    folder
2. Provide quick and simple instructions on how to run the app (ideally be a short
    README in the project).
● **Bonus tasks** ​ (in case the above doesn’t reflect your skill level, add one or both of these
features):
1. Create an additional version of the app, which uses a completely ​ _different_ ​ UI
(different layout and styling, not just different colours!).
2. Add the ability for a user to click on any of the currencies returned in the results table
to display a historical chart of that currency's rate, over the last 12 months.

## Notes

● There is no strict target time for this task, but do give us an indication how long this might
take you.
● One of the simplest APIs for FX rates is ​exchangeratesapi.io​, but feel free to choose another.
● We are primarily looking for good software practices. Do what you feel necessary to deliver a
production-ready solution!
● Let us know if you have any questions or run into any insurmountable problems.
**Good luck!
